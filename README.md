This project is originally from simple framework for an adventure game. In the original version, it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
It was modified by Peter Grose to have additional functionality and documentation, in order to practice my object-oriented programming and project documentation skills.

Read chapter 7 of the book to get a detailed description of the original project.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its "play" method.
